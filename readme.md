My first deep neural network, designed to recognize pictures of handwritten digits from 0-9 from the MNIST dataset. Will also work with custom drawn images as long as they are 28x28 and are saved in the same directory as the script and named custom.png to make custom images I highly recommend using https://jspaint.app/ just hit ctrl+e and set the height and width to 28 and draw a number.
